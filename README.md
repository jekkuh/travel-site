This is a Fictional Travel Agency Site created through the course <b>Git A Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Worlflow</b> by Brad Schiff on Udemy.

It uses :
<ul>
<li>Npm</li>
<li>NodeJs</li>
<li>Gulp</li>
<li>postCSS</li>
<li>Bem Naming</li>
<li>Browser Sync</li>
<li>Automatic Sprites</li>
<li>Babel & Webpack</li>
<li>Lazy Loading Images</li>
<li>Svg Icons</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

He teaches Object-oriented Javascript, ES6, and also gives job interview tips. I Highly suggest this course to anyone learning web Development. 

This course taught me a lot about what a real world developer does and has helped me increase my overall knowledge and skillset. The Bom.com !
